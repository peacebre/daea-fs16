KV20 is at the base of a cliff facing towards Hatshepsut's mortuary temple, Djeser-Djeseru. Inside the tomb, it has been described as steep and length of the tomb is quite impressive. The different stratum layers in the stone created a unique difficulty when it was first excavated by Howard Carter in 1903. The first stratum was limestone, which made the entrance stable when excavations began. The second stratum, however, was made up of marl, which is unstable sedimentary rock and caused a few cave ins throughout the tomb. KV 20, as a result, has been described as the most dangerous tomb within the Valley of the Kings. ",<a href="sites/kv20/kv20.html">MORE DETAILS</a>
